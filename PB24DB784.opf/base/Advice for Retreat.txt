Advice for Retreat[1]

from Kyabjé Trulshik Rinpoche

Through the wisdom of study, the boundaries of the outer retreat are set.Through the wisdom
of contemplation, the boundaries of the inner retreat are set.And through the wisdom of meditation,
the boundaries of the secret retreat are set. For this, having set a boundary for
all thoughts, perceptions of the six senses, and promptings of hope and fear, to settle
into an ongoing experience of the untainted vast expanse is the essence of what we call "retreat."[2]

Remaining is the ground;Unaltered is the path;Non-obtaining is the fruit;Hope and fear are the
demons.Struck by wonder, yet all is transparent and clear—this is inexhaustible great bliss.
