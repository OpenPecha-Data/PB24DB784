Advice for Tenzin Jamchen

by Kyabje Trulshik Rinpoche

The Buddha said to tame one's mind.Recognise all those of the three realms,Particularly the
three lower realms, as your mother;And cultive relative bodhicitta.Train continuously in love
and compassion.Absolute bodhicitta means to recognise all phenomenaAs unreal, just like
dreams, an illusion and so on.Recognise the eight worldly dharmas, whether pure, impure
or a mixture, as poison.And rely on the supreme medicine instead.Make the noble attitude of
cherishing others more than yourself,Supreme bodhicitta, your primary concern.Ema! How meritorious
it is to have the support of this human life!Aho! How auspicious to practise this
yoga!

The wholly bewildered mendicant, a follower of Śākyamuni called Gyurme Ngawang Chökyi Lodrö,
wrote this in response to a request from the English bhikṣu, the dialectician Tenzin Jamchen
(Sean Price). Siddhirastu!
