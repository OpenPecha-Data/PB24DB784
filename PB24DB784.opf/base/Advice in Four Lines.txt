Advice in Four Lines

by Kyabje Trulshik Rinpoche

Cultivate love and compassion for those who are suffering.Rejoice in the good fortune of those
who are happy.Do not ponder anything else, but pray to the guru!Look into your own mind
and sustain the clear awareness that is its true nature.

When the supreme and gracious Tulku Pema Wangyal Rinpoche said that his students required some
advice in four simple statements, I, the Dharmaless charlatan with the name of the abbot
Shadeu Trulshik, wrote down whatever came to mind and offered it from MƒÅratika cave.
