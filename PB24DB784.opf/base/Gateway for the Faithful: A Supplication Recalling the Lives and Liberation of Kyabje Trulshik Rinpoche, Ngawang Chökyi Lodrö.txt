ku nyi zungjuk ten ching drel jung chö
To bring about the dependent arising of the union of the two kāyas,
dön nyi zungjuk tashi palbar shok
So that the union of twofold benefit may blaze in perfect splendour!

Leaving aside the obvious lack of virtue or benefit for the teaching of Buddha or beings, writing
such things as this supplication can only be a further cause of one’s own delusion and
obscuration. However, the faithful and enthusiastic practitioner Lama Ngawang of Tangme
Monastery, Solukhumbu, Nepal, as well as the learned and accomplished Kyarok Nyala Tenzin,
and the sublime Lama Ngawang Chöpel of Kulung, all made repeated requests over many years
and offered gifts. To these were added the urging of my master Dzatrul Ngawang Tenzin Norbu’s
relative, Prajñābhadra, and the repeated urgings of many other dharma friends — accompanied
by gifts of divine silken scarves — particularly the renowned tulku of Sang-ngak Kharwa
Ganden Dhargye, he who beautifully adorns the Geluk tradition, Kyabje Lobzang Tsultrim
Rinpoche, who offered a celestial scarf along with ten garlands of dried dates to make
everything auspicious. He strongly urged me to write a supplication to the garland of my previous
lives and, at best, an autobiography. If this would not be possible, he insisted,
I must write at least a few verses recounting the events of my life. With all these many requests
made from on high, from below and everywhere else in-between serving as the principal
cause and the promise of the chanting master Ngawang Zöpa, the retreatant Ngawang Sangye,
my relative the nun Ngawang Yeshe, Ngawang Tayé of Kulung, and many others to immediately
carve the wood blocks and print the book as the condition, I reflected: It was obvious
to me at least that I do not possess even a tiny fraction of the qualities that these sublime
ones possess even in the hairs on their body. This is something I know myself and which
anyone else, whether learned or foolish, can either see directly or infer. Nevertheless,
the sublime protector whose kindness is unequalled, the great Vajradhara, Dzatrul Rinpoche,
in his infinite wisdom proclaimed me to be the successor to this garland of lives, perhaps
to create an auspicious condition for my becoming their disciple in future lives. I drew
upon accounts of the successive lives of these learned and accomplished master of the
Old and New traditions, such as Jonang Tāranātha, who claimed to be an emanation of the Lord
of Secrets Vajradharma and of Pagor Vairotsana, Minling Terchen, Shadeu Trulshik Kunga
Rinchen, and the previous Trulshik Rinpoche — the bodhisattva Tongdrol Dorje and others, as
well as valid sources such as the Great Mask biography of Vairotsana. I thus provided simple
accounts of the main deeds of each figure and supplemented this with a brief synopsis
of some of my own more positive actions during this present life. Maṅgalam!
