The Vajradhara who upholds the three sets of vows, Dzarong Trulshik Shadeu Tulku Ngawang Chökyi
Lodrö Rinpoche, enthusiastically drank from the nectar of the ocean-like sutras and tantras
before many masters from all traditions including venerable holders of the Ngagyur Nyingma
teachings, such as Dzatrul Ngawang Tenzin Norbu, Minling Chung Rinpoche, Dudjom Rinpoche,
as well as teachers of the Gelug tradition such as the former Ganden Tri Chetsang Lhundrup
Tsöndru Rinpoche, my precious preceptor of incomparable kindness the great Ling Trichen
Dorje Chang, Dregé Gendun Tashi and so on, until the excellent vase of his mind was
filled to the brim. In particular, he was appointed the successor of the great Vajradhara
Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Gyurme Tekchok Tenpé Gyaltsen.When he said that he was approaching
the age of seventy-eight and his nephew and close disciple Gelong Ngawang Chöpel Gyatso
made a request with the support of some offerings for something to be written that could be
recited during the ceremonies for his long life, as other enthusiastic disciples made similar
requests, and I myself was inspired by faith and joy as I remembered his kindness in
granting me so many profound empowerments, explanations, transmissions and instructions,
the respectful student and buddhist monk Tenzin Gyatso wrote this on the first day of the
first month of the Iron Snake year of the 17th calendrical cycle (24th February 2001).May
it be the cause for these aspirations being accomplished!
