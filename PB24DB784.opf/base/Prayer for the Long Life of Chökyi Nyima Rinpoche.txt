Prayer for the Long Life of Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche
by Kyabjé Trulshik Rinpoche

om swasti, chok sum tsa sum gyalwa gyatso yi
Oṃ svasti. May the oceanic victorious ones, the Three Jewels and Three Roots
ka nying chö kyi tenpé nyima ché
Grant their blessings so that this great sun of the Kagyü and Nyingma Dharma teachings
sang sum takten tendrö shyé dön kun
May remain with his three secrets (of body, speech and mind) forever secure and firm,
ma lü yong su drubpar jin gi lob
And so that all his wishes for the teachings and beings may be entirely fulfilled!

With deep trust and hope, this aspiration was made by the monk-follower of Śākyamuni, Vāgindra
Dharmamati. May virtuous goodness increase.
