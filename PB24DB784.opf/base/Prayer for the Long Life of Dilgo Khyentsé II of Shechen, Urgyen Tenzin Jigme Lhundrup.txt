Prayer for the Long Life of Dilgo Khyentsé II of Shechen, Urgyen Tenzin Jigme Lhundrup
by Trulshik Rinpoche

om svasti, rabjam sé ché gyalwé tukjé dang
Oṃ svasti! Through the compassion of the infinite buddhas and bodhisattvas,
mejung tsawa sum gyi jinlab kyi
And the blessing of wondrous gurus, devas, and ḍākinīs,
jetsün lama khyentsé ter chenpö
The beloved master Khyentsé, treasure of knowledge and love,
samshyin trulpé dögar tsungda dral
Has manifested his matchless compassion, just as all have wished:
orgyen jé dang ridral do ngak kyi
Fearless Holder of the teachings of the Lord of Orgyen
tendzin jikmé chok lé namgyalwé
And of the non-partisan tradition of sūtras and tantras,
shyabpé mishik dorjé kham su ten
All-victorious one, let your life be forever firm and indestructible;
pendé shyedön mabé lhündrub shok
And accomplish, spontaneously and without effort, your vision—of present happiness and ultimate
bliss!

For the sake of auspiciousness, our guide throughout samsaric existence and the peace of nirvana,
our refuge and protector, the supreme lord of Victorious Ones, His Holiness the Dalai
Lama, kindly bestowed a name upon the precious reincarnation of the lord of refuges, the
great Vajradhara Dilgo Khyentsé, at the long life cave of Māratika, at the same time as he
was offered a set of robes. There, on the excellent eighth day of the waxing phase of the
auspicious eleventh month of the Wood Pig year—Friday, 29 December 1995—the bewildered bhikṣu
Shadeu Trulshik, Vāgindra Dharmamati, wrote and offered this, with a single-minded aspiration.
Jayantu!
