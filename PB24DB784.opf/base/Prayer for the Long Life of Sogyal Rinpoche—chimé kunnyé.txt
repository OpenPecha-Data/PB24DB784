Prayer for the Long Life of Sogyal Rinpoche
by Kyabjé Trulshik Rinpoche

om svasti, chimé ku nyé pema jungné dang
Oṃ svasti! Through the power and blessings of Padmasambhava, who has attained the deathless
wisdom body, and
jetsün nyurma pamö tu jin gyi
The Glorious Tārā, swift to act,
terchen sönam gyalpö trulpé kü
May the incarnation of the 'King of Merit', the great Tertön Sogyal,
shyabzung takten trinlé tarchin shok
Enjoy a life that is secure and long: may all his enlightened activities be completely fulfilled!

On behalf of the matchless Sogyal Rinpoche, the glorious protector of the Vajrayāna teachings
and all beings—especially in the West—the Buddhist monk Shadeupa Trulshik Ngawang Chökyi
Lodrö composed this long-life prayer in a single verse, along with this heartfelt prayer
that it be accomplished!
