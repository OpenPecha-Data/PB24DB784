Oṃ svasti! Your marvellous form manifests from measureless acts of merit.
dé sum long gü chö dra künné drok
Far and wide you make the Dzogchen teachings of the Three Categories and Nine Spaces resound.
ngagyur tenpé gyaltsen trulpé ku
You are the incarnation who is the victory banner of the Ancient Tradition:
shyabzung takten gurü jingyi lob
May the blessing of Guru Rinpoche make your life forever secure and firm!

This prayer was composed by the monk Dharma Vāgindra, known as Trulshik Rinpoche, to bless the
object of meditation of the peerless incarnation Sogyal Rinpoche, Padmasambhava's representative
in the West. Siddhirastu!
