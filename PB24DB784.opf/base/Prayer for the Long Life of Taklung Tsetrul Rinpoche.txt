Prayer for the Long Life of Taklung Tsetrul Rinpoche
by Kyabjé Trulshik Rinpoche

om swati
Oṃ svasti!
tsa sum gyalwa gyatsö jin tu lé
Through the power and blessings of the infinite victorious ones and deities of the three roots,
dren chok shé drup nyinjé shyap pé ten
May the life of this supreme guide, Shedrup Nyinjé, be forever firm,
tupten chi dang é wam chok gar bé
May his glorious activity for the Buddhadharma in general and the tradition of Ewam Chogar in
particular,
trinlé pal gyé dro pen zang por shok
Spread far and wide, bringing the most excellent benefit to all!

This was written and offered with a positive intention and prayers of aspiration by the ignorant
buddhist monk known as Ngawang Chökyi Lodrö on the occasion of fulfilling the wishes
of the supreme Taklung Tsetrul Rinpoche, the great luminary of the Ancient Translation teachings,
by consecrating the Nyungné temple and its images, on the fifth day of the first month
of the Iron Dragon year (2000).
