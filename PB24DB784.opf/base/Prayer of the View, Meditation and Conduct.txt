Prayer of the View, Meditation and Conduct
by Trulshik Rinpoche

Namo guru!
chönyi rigpa rangjung dümajé
The primordial ground, the great, ever-pure primordial emptiness,
yé né shyir dzok pogyur trö kündral
Which is free from all elaboration and change,
dömé tongchen kané dakpa yi
Is the very nature of uncompounded and self-arising awareness:
tawa rang ngotrö par jingyi lob
Bless me so that I may recognize the view, my very own nature.

machö long der ma yeng ngang gom gyi
To meditate without distraction in this uncontrived expanse,
mi tro mi du sam jödral bar shyak
Which has neither contraction nor expansion, is simply to settle,
ku sum lhündrub rigpé shi luk der
Without thought or expression, in natural awareness – the three kāyas:
takchö lo dejung bar jingyi lob
Bless me so that I may meditate like this, with decisiveness and ease.

khordé chö küntokpa gangshar yang
All thoughts of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are unbound and naturally liberated,
ma ching rangdrol nyenpö tsolmé par
And there is no need for effort-based antidotes
panglang lé dé yedrol chenpö ngang
In this, the great, primordial liberation beyond adoption and rejection:
shardrol rimé jungwar jingyi lob
Bless me so that I may realize this great, all-encompassing liberation upon arising.

detar chok sang dzogpachenpo yi
The supremely secret view, meditation, conduct and result of the Great Perfection
ta gom chö dré lamé drin gyi tok
Are to be realized through the guru’s kindness,
rangrig lamar sharwé mögü kyi
And the devotion of one’s own awareness arising as the guru:
jinlab nying la jukpar jingyi lob
Bless me so that your inspiration and blessings may enter my heart.

Written at the request of the faithful Changchub Chökyi Drolma by the one called Chökyi Lodrö,
i.e., Kyabje Trulshik Rinpoche.
