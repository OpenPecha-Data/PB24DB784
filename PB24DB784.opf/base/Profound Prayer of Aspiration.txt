Profound Prayer of Aspiration1
by Kyabjé Trulshik Rinpoche

rangjung dömé gönpo kuntuzang
The naturally arisen primordial protector Samantabhadra
rangché shyuk kyang trulpé dön ma tok
Is intrinsically present, but in my delusion I fail to recognize it.
chok sum lamar solwa tabpa lé
To the gurus and Three Jewels, I pray:
rang ngo rang gi shepar jingyi lob
Bless me that I may recognize my own true face!

Written by Kyabje Trulshik Rinpoche at Tashi Pelbar Ling (La Sonnerie) on the fourth day of
the tenth month of the Iron Snake year 2128 (19 November 2001).
